About TypeScript : 

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is an object-oriented and tightly typed programming language. TypeScript code is transformed to JavaScript, which may be used in any environment that supports JavaScript, including browsers, Node.js, and your own applications.

TypeScript was created in response to the limitations of JavaScript for constructing large-scale applications within Microsoft and among its external customers. There was a demand for bespoke tooling to make developing JavaScript components easier due to the complexity of working with complicated JavaScript code.
 
TypeScript is a variant of JavaScript with a few more features. TypeScript extends JavaScript with extra syntax to provide a more robust interface with your editor. TypeScript is a scripting language that is compatible with JavaScript and relies on type inference to deliver advanced functionality without the need for additional code.
